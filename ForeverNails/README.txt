A Web Application for a small business "ForeverNails&Spa"

I'm using Python, Django framework, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git 
for this project.

This web application was created so this small business can have a 
website that customer can register/log into and schedule appointments 
for Beauty services. I wanted to take things further and make a Customer, 
Employee, and Owner section.

Customer Section includes: personal information, scheduling appointment, 
rewards, and special discount for birthday.

Employee Section includes: Clock In/Out, Turn Based Service for Walk-In 
customer (when a customer walks into the shop and they request a service, 
an employee will be assigned to them based on a turn system and their skill),
and Service perform on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.

Owner Section includes: Services performed per employees and all employees on
a daily, weekly, monthly basis, revenue generated on a daily, weekly, monthly,
annual basis, timesheet for employees, reviews/customer feedback per the 
employee and the business as a whole.

Future Update: mobile and tablet applications used for customer/guest check 
in for walk-in customer, wait timer, and text message notifications for 
waiting customer.
